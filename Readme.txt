README:Website Section:Description: The ‘html’ folder contains the datasets as well as the main html page for which our visualization is built upon. This folder is the main folder, and all visualizations should be run on the main.html file. The data_process folder contains the files required to get the prediction data as well as the precompiled results.Installation: You can either extract the ‘Code’ folder to another directory or you can keep it where it currently is. Make sure you have a python version > 3, a stable internet connection and the latest version of Google Chrome. Execution: To run the html file you must ‘cd’ into the directory where the html folder is located (ex: Name/Desktop/html). Once you are in the right directory you simply input ‘python3 -m http.server’ into your terminal. Then open Google Chrome and navigate to ‘http://localhost:8000/’. From there select on the main.html file to view the visualization.Data Section:Files:COBRA-2021.csv Original crime datasetDemograph.csv Original demographic datasetevents_semester.csv Scraped events data over whole semestereve_new.csv Filtered events data to only include March events and festivals, sports and terrorin_final_3.csv Input data that includes the April events to predict oninput.csv Input data to train onmarch_crime.csv Only includes crime occured during march 2021no_dupes.csv Removes duplicates of Neighborhoods between beats. Contains joined demographic data including manually inputed household incomesource_data.csv Contains all beats with duplicate neighborhoodsfinal_output.csv Direct Output from R modelouput_update.csv Output Updated to include all beatsInstructions:Follow the instructions in the first part of preprocess.ipynb in order to get the input data to train on for the model.Input.csv is a precompiled result.Run the model.R file in order to get the final_output.csv. Load the final_output.csv into preprocess.ipynb to run part 2 and get predictions that includes all beats in output_update.csv.Take the updated prediction and input it into crime_data.csv within the html folder. Treat beat 114 as 0s.
